> A fast, efficient web crawler built with Python

This crawler efficiently maps websites by identifying and traversing all links within a domain while ignoring external links and subdomains.



## ✨ Development Notes & Design Decisions

### 🛠️ Core Environment & Structure
- Installed expected core libraries (`aiohttp`, `beautifulsoup4`) for web crawling.
- Created an `application/` directory to organize main app logic and encourage modularity.
- Added `requirements.txt` for reproducible environments.
- Introduced a `Makefile` for quick execution of common developer tasks.

### 📊 Code Quality & Tooling
- Installed and configured `black` (auto-formatting) and `pylint` (linting) for code consistency.
- Included a `pylintrc` file to suppress common false positives and tailor linting to project needs.
- Used GitHub Copilot to help with docstrings and basic exception handling, always manually reviewed.

### 🔄 Crawler Architecture
- Developed a `WebCrawler` class as the main interface for crawling logic, starting with single-URL handling and expanding to full domain traversal.
- Switched from `requests` to `aiohttp` for non-blocking async requests, boosting speed and resource efficiency for large crawls.
- Added a file manager utility for saving crawl results locally in multiple formats (e.g., plain text, JSON), designed for scalability with large output sets.
- **When saving links to a file, links are written in chunks**—this approach allows the crawler to handle massive sites without excessive memory usage, ensuring Python's memory footprint remains stable even when crawling hundreds of thousands of links.

### 💻 CLI & User Experience
- Added a robust command-line interface using `argparse` for flexible configuration and easy terminal use.
- Implemented input validation to prevent crawling invalid or malformed URLs.
- Included user-agent headers in requests to mimic real-world browsers and minimize blocking by target domains.
- Considered and noted rate-limiting strategies to avoid overwhelming servers.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- Began a basic `pytest` test suite to cover primary crawler functionality (unit tests for core features).
- Centralized logging and configured output directories for clean organization and easy troubleshooting.

### 📈 Scalability & Maintainability
- Designed file saving and log handling to work efficiently even with a large volume of discovered URLs.
- Adopted type hints throughout for improved readability and maintainability.
- Regularly updated the `Makefile` to streamline tasks (e.g., install dependencies, run linter, run tests).


## 🚀 Future Improvements (mix of tech debt and new features)

- Count the number of times each URL is seen across the website (to identify heavily linked content).
- Track HTTP response codes from pages as a health check to find bad links or pages.
- Track the time taken to crawl each page to help identify slow or heavy pages.
- Track the size of each page (in bytes/kilobytes) to help spot large or potentially problematic pages.
- Track the number of images on each page to help pinpoint content-heavy or slow-loading pages.
- Allow the async crawler to be started via an API, and expose crawling functionality via a template file for non-technical users.
- Add more tests to cover additional edge cases and increase overall test coverage.
- Continue refactoring according to `pylint` suggestions for style and best practices.
- Further refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Enhance CLI feedback for a better user experience.
- Improve logging for better monitoring and debugging.
- Improve exception and error handling to cover more edge cases.

## 🏁 Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with the Zego Site Crawler quickly.

### 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zego-site-crawler.git
   cd zego-site-crawler
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

### 🔍 Running the Crawler

Run the crawler in interactive mode:
```bash
make run
```

The interactive mode will guide you through:
- Entering a URL to crawl
- Choosing whether to save results to a file
- Specifying the output file path
- Enabling/disabling verbose logging
- Setting the maximum number of concurrent requests

### 📄 Output Formats

The crawler supports multiple output formats based on the file extension:

- `.txt`: Plain text format
- `.csv`: CSV format with page URLs and their links
- `.json`: JSON format with structured data
